# variables are defined with the let KEYWORD

let a = 10

# variables can be of 7 types:
# Number, String, Array, Dict, Boolean, Null, Function

# variables can be redefined after being declared with the let keyword. However they cant be declared again.

# let a = 10 would be wrong here

a = [1, 2, 3]
a = "Hello World"
a = {name: "John", age: 20}
a = true
a = tag {return 1 + 2} # this is a function
a = null
