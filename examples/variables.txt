# declaring a variable

let variable_name = 1
# variable_name is now assigned the value: 1

# we can assign different types of data to a variable
# let variable_name = "hello world"
# However the above line would error
# since variable_name was already declared with the let keyword.
# we can however reassign it.

variable_name = "hello world"
# This Works!

# More data types are below:
variable_name = 1.0 # this is also a Number!
variable_name = true # this is a Boolean
variable_name = [1, 2, 3] # this is an Array

# Arrays are a collection of different data types all in one. THey can contain anything that the language supports. Even other arrays!
variable_name = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] # This is totally valid!

variable_name = {"key": "value", "key2": "value2"} # this is a Dictionary

# Dictionaries are a collection of key value pairs. The key and the value can be anything that the language supports. Even other dictionaries!
# but it is preferred and recommended that Dictionaries only have strings as keys.
variable_name = {"key": {"key": "value"}, "key2": {"key": "value"}} # This is also valid!

# We also have a special data type called Null
# it basically means nothing. It is used to represent the absence of a value.

variable_name = null # this is a Null value

# variables can also contain unnamed (lambda) functions, created with the tag keyword
variable_name = tag { return x + 1 }

# functions are descrbed better in their own section
