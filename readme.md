# TBD
A scripting language for use inside discord through bots.

## Features

Currently only supports arithmetic expressions and assignments with the let and const keywords.
More features coming soon...

## How to run

Discord bot implementation hasnt been added yet but you can use this as a standalone script interpreter.

To run:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal
3. Run the command `python3 -m src`

That's it! A REPL will be activated, however it's a shitty REPL and doesn't really REPL.
You write multiple lines of code and it reads them then after an empty line, evaluates all the lines together.

I know it's shitty ok.
